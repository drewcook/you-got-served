# You Got Served

You Got Served is a POS system to allow servers to easily manage tables, checks, and food items. The server has the ability to view table details, add checks to tables, add and void food items to checks, calculate totals, and close checks.

## Develop

This app is built using Next.js, so it can easily be run using the built in server.

First install all dependencies: `npm install`.

To run the application locally, run the following command: `npm run dev`.

The application will spin up on a local port.

## Demo

There is a beta production app hosted at https://yougotserved.herokuapp.com/.
